# A little bit about me

Nice to meet you! Even though I'm interested in almost everything, work-wise my interests include Porting, Rendering, Emulation and Optimization. 
My language of preference is C++, althought I've worked with C, C#, ASM, Python, HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and made a few IOS apps using Swift and Firebase. Also, with gpahical APIs such as OpenGL and DX12.
