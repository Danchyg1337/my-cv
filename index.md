# A little bit about me

Nice to meet you! I'm Denis, a 24 years old programmer. Even though i'm interested in almost everything, work-wise my interests include Porting, Rendering, Emulation, Optimization. 
My language of preference is C++, althought i've worked with C, C#, ASM, Python, HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL. Also, with gpahical APIs such as OpenGL and DX12.
